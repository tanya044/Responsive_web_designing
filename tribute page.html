                     <strong>1983</strong> - Thompson and himself received the Turing Award for their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system. His Turing Award lecture was titled "Reflections on Software Research".
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <strong>1990</strong> - Thompson and himself received the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), "for the origination of the UNIX operating system and the C programming language".

                  <li>
                     <strong>1999</strong> - 
                  Thompson and himself jointly received the National Medal of Technology of 1998 from President Bill Clinton for co-inventing the UNIX operating system and the C programming language which, according to the citation for the medal, "led to enormous advances in computer hardware, software, and networking systems and stimulated growth of an entire industry, thereby enhancing American leadership in the Information Age".
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <strong>2005</strong> - The Industrial Research Institute awarded him with its Achievement Award in recognition of his contribution to science and technology, and to society generally, with his development of the Unix operating system
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <strong>2011</strong> -  He, along with Thompson, was awarded the Japan Prize for Information and Communications for his work in the development of the Unix operating system.
